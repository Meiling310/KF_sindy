# KTF_sindy
KTF_sindy_AIC model is a physics-informed sparse-regression approach for aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions (ACPI) as a coupled multiscale system with time delay. This code shows the discovery of a single delay-differential equation (DDE) that conceptually captures ACPI (KTF model, Koren et al. (2017))
